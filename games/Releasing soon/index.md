📜 Code of Conduct – Roleplay Game
Welcome to our roleplay community! To ensure a safe, fair, and immersive RP experience, the following rules apply:

1. 🔒 Respect & Safety
Treat everyone with respect, both IC (in-character) and OOC (out-of-character).

Discrimination, hate speech, bullying, or inappropriate behavior is not tolerated.

Do not make real-life threats or use sensitive topics (e.g., suicide, terrorism) in or out of RP.

2. 🧠 RP Quality & Behavior
Stay in character (IC) while playing, unless you clearly indicate you are talking OOC.

Use realistic and logical actions that fit your role and the situation.

No powergaming (forcing actions on others without their consent).

No metagaming (using knowledge your character wouldn’t realistically have).

No fail-RP or unrealistic behavior that breaks immersion.

3. 🛑 Forbidden Behavior
No RDM (Random Deathmatch) or VDM (Vehicle Deathmatch).

No combat logging (logging out to avoid RP or consequences).

No use of exploits, cheats, or third-party software.

No loot or grinding abuse in non-designated areas or contexts.

4. 🏛️ Law & Rules
Follow in-game laws and respect in-game authorities as part of the RP world.

IC actions with serious OOC consequences may lead to OOC punishment.

Criminal RP is allowed but must be realistic, planned, and not spammed.

5. 🗨️ Communication
Use OOC chat only when necessary or for brief questions—keep it minimal.

Only use Discord/radio/phones IC if your character realistically has access.

OOC conflict? Solve it calmly or contact a staff member.

6. 👮 Staff & Reports
Always follow staff instructions.

Staff decisions are final. If you disagree, submit a respectful appeal through Discord or our form.

Abusing the report system (e.g. false reports) will lead to punishment.

🛡️ Punishments for Breaking the Rules
If you break the rules, you may receive:

Warnings

Temporary bans

Permanent removal from the community
